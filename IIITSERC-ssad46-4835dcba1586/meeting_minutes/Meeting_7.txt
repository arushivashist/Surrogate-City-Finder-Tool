Meeting with Aviruch Sir

We discussed mainly about the requirements that we would cover for R1. It was
decided to do parameter based searching(latitude, altitude, radius) of the
cities whose data is present with ranges of parameter given with respect to the
city typed in the search bar. The cities would be searched in the database
satisfying the parameters. Then they would be marked on the map.
   R1 would cover the things mentioned above.
   We also discussed about further requirements of the client(to be done after
R1), which included searching the best city for the input city and compare
them by plotting graphs of Temperature on a monthly basis.
