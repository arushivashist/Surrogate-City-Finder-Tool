SSAD Meet-3
Date - 18/08/14
Meeting with Team Mentor and T.A. Aman Arora

This was the first meet with Aman Sir. It started with us telling him about the previous meetings with 
Raghu Sir and Aviruch Sir.

We first discussed about our project in detail, viz, Surrogate City finder tool and the expectations of
the client from us.

Then we talked about the framework which we would want to use for the project. Frameworks such as Web2py, Jango,
 'Ruby on Rails', etc. were brought up in the discussion. 

The final decision for the framework to be used was not decided in the meeting. However, Aman Sir suggested not
to use Web2py as it has a lot of problems in using. But finally, he left it on us to use the framework of our choice.

The meeting concluded with the hope of having the first meeting with the project client soon as Sir was out of station till that time and we
weren't able to meet him .
