SSAD Meet-6

Date - 22/09/14

Meeting with team mentor and team mates

Our team faced the problem of marking so many cities on the world map(around 15000).
We expressed our concern to the mentor. We concluded that we must mark lesser cities
 as it is not possible to mark so many cities using Google API.
 	We also discussed about the requirements somewhat and the SRS document.
